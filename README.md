# BALDW64

A personalized, probabilistic, and obfuscated hashing algorithm inspired from SHA-2 built for security, deception, and performance.

**NOTE:** BALDW64 is an experimental hash function designed for research and creative security applications. It is not a replacement for industry-standard algorithms and should not be used in production systems without extensive analysis and peer review.

More details coming soon.
